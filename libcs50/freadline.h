/* freadLine - Safely read a line of input into `buf`.
 *
 * Caller provides buffer `buf` with room for `len` characters.
 * Caller provides open file `fp`.
 * We fill `buf` by reading characters from file `fp`,
 * guaranteeing we won't over-run the end of the buffer,
 * guaranteeing a newline-terminated, null-terminated string in the buffer;
 * returning true if success and false if EOF or any error.
 * If the user enters more than len-2 characters, that is considered an error.
 * If end-of-file is reached before newline, that is considered an error.
 * If an error occurs, buf may have been written but should be untrusted.
